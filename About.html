                <h3>Hi, I'm Isobel</h3>
                <p>I like piña coladas and getting caught in the rain…</p>
                
                <p>Wait! Wrong platform.<i> Let’s try that again.</i></p>

                <p>Based in Brisbane, I have a unique set of skills born from studies in both fine arts 
                    and computer science. 
                    After working in marketing for three years, I’ve made a career pivot into the technology 
                    industry and have successfully obtained a position on the CommBank Enterprise Services 
                    Graduate Program for 2021.</p>

                <p>I quickly discovered that my niche lies at the intersection of creativity and innovation, 
                    and am excited about the potential that technology offers – including the chance to 
                    positively impact a wide range of people. </p>

                <p>My skill set is always evolving, but currently I am comfortable coding in a range of 
                    languages, including HTML/CSS and Python. I also have an outstanding brownie recipe 
                    which I am happy share (much like Rupert Holmes: I am not much into health foods – 
                    I am into champagne). </p>

                <p>If you want to swipe right (in a purely professional sense), check out my portfolio 
                    or get in touch!</p>
